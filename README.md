A curated list of ARK resources

## What is it

ARK is a new bitcoin layer2 protocol proposed by [Burak Ke√ßeli](https://twitter.com/brqgoo).
The non-interactive version requires covenants (which can be achieved using CTV or APO) however using n-of-n multisig you can
have a simplified version requiring all participants to be online.
